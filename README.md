# Credit
- This project is originally base on [Avimitin/nvim](https://github.com/Avimitin/nvim)  ( I highly recommend it to be your first template.)
- It's originally inspired by
  - [glepnir/nvim](https://github.com/glepnir/nvim)
  - [jdhao/nvim-config](https://github.com/jdhao/nvim-config)

Anyway, take a look at their contribution, which is really fantastic.
